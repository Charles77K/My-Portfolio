            I&apos;m Charles Obiora, a passionate software developer who loves
            turning ideas into functional, creative solutions. My journey into
            tech has been anything but linear, and that&apos;s what makes it
            unique.

            Attracted to the craft of visual storytelling, I began my career as
            a graphics designer. However, during my time at university,
            curiosity drew me to coding. Unlike most people who begin with web
            development, I got right into app development because I was
            captivated by how software influences user the way user engages with
            app.

            My interest grew beyond merely creating interfaces as I advanced in
            the field, I became interested in learning about the inner workings
            of backend development.I eventually embrace web development,
            combining these skills to produce flawless applications.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            Today, I focus on building mobile and web applications, continuously
            learning and pushing myself to provide innovative solutions. Iâ€™m
            driven by curiosity, a passion for clean code, and the excitement of
            solving real-world problems through technology.
